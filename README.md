# HBFC-Bank---Personal-Loans
"This project is about solving a business requirement of improving uptake of personal loans. Study various variables of different types given in the study through Exploratory data analysis using charts, Pivot tables and some statistical measures"
# Requirements
This case is about a bank (HBFC Bank) which has a growing customer base. Majority of these customers 
are customers having deposits (Saving, Current) and Term Deposit (including Fixed Deposits and 
Recurring deposit accounts) in the bank. The number of customers who are also borrowers (customers 
having loan accounts) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in 
more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. In particular, the 
management wants to explore ways of converting its customers having deposits to personal loan 
customers (while retaining them as depositors).
The bank wants to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have a 
higher probability of purchasing the loan. For doing that, the first step in this regard is to explore the 
previous data and drill insights.
You have been provided with a dataset of 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic 
information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, 
etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan).
You are brought in as a consultant and your job is to explore the data to understand the variables 
and the impact they have had on Personal Loans so that the bank can leverage the insights to 
reach out to the right customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan.
